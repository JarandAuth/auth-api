# auth-api

OAuth 2.0 Authorization server implemented based on the documentation at https://www.oauth.com/

Grant types supported:

- client_credentials
- refresh_token
- password

Note:

- The API is currently version 0 (v0) and may get breaking changes. The version will be incremented to version 1 (v1) when the API is more stable and later breaking changes will result in a new
  version.

## Upcoming changes

See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/JarandAuth/auth-api/issues)

## Contributing

I want to implement as much functionality as possible myself to learn about OAuth 2.0. If you find something not implemented according to the guide at https://oauth.com, I would really appreciate if
you submit an issue explaining what's wrong. You might as well submit a pull request fixing it if you want, but that's definitely not required.

### Feature requests

The project does not currently accept new feature requests.
